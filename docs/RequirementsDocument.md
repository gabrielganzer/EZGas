# Abstract

People driving a car, a truck or a motorbike, whether they have a gasoline, diesel or gas engine, need to get fuel from gas stations. The choice of a gas station is made considering mainly two factors: closeness to the pump and price of the fuel.
A team of developers decides to make this process easier by developing an application that retrieves data from the people contribution (crowdsourcing). Who downloads the app can use it either to locate the closest gas stations in the area along with their fuel prices or to contribute by updating the fuel price in an existing gas station. The application is able to show the gas stations both through a list view or a map view, while the fuel prices, specified for a gas station, are computed considering the average value of the 10 most recent fuel price updates from the last 3 days.
The users have different ways to interact with the system, besides searching, such as: ask for new gas stations to be added into the system, send reviews of gas stations and price updates, thus the app can always be kept up to date.


# Stakeholders

# Stories and personas

Eleanor is a young regional volleyball referee that cares about a smart management of her outgoings. She owns a car with a diesel engine and because of her job she often needs to drive it around the region she lives in to reach all the sports hall where volley matches are held.
During her job trips, Eleanor always takes the smartphone and uses the navigator application to get oriented in highways and cities she has never visited before. Frequently happens that she runs low on fuel so that she needs to find a gas station as soon as possible, preferably one from her favorite oil company where she can gain fidelity points for every liter of purchased fuel. Otherwise, she tends to choose the closest gas station that has the lowest fuel price.

Barbara is a mother with a son and a daughter. Every morning, before going to work, she brings them to primary school following always the same street path that includes passing by two gas stations from two different oil companies. Barbara wants to be an example for her children and so, when she arrives at work, she always tells her colleagues about the fuel prices she has read while driving the car, in order to let them choose the cheapest option if they need to fill up the tank.

Max is a 26 years old boy owning a motorbike that he uses a lot for traveling around the country. He likes sharing with other people his driving experiences and, in order to do this, he always gives reviews and comments about the places he goes to during his travels. He would certainly give a powerful boost to a crowdsourcing application and become soon a moderator, able to analyze requests from users just like Maxâ€™s friends usually do with him.

Patrick is a gas station owner really inclined to new technologies and everyday-use applications. He always does his best to let his customers satisfied with the services and quality offered by his own gas station. He would be really interested in a way to allow everybody to know he has one of the best gas stations, with the best possible rating and, almost always, the lower fuel prices in the area.
