# Estimation approach

Estimation made on the base of past experiences in project management


# Estimate by product decomposition

### 

|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed | 6 |             
| A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC | 180 |
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | 1080 |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour) | 108 |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 3240 |
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) | 2 weeks |
